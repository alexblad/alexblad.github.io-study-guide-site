                <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Differential heating on Earth is primarily caused by:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Angle of Solar Radiation:</strong> The sun's rays strike the Earth more directly (at a higher angle) near the equator, spreading over a smaller area and leading to more intense heating. Near the poles, the rays strike at a lower angle, spreading over a larger area and leading to less intense heating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Albedo:</strong> Different surfaces reflect different amounts of solar radiation. Ice and snow have high albedo (reflect a lot), while dark surfaces like oceans and forests have low albedo (absorb a lot).</li>
                    <li><strong>Presence of Water:</strong> Water has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it heats up and cools down more slowly than land. This moderates temperatures in coastal areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Cover:</strong> Clouds can reflect incoming solar radiation, reducing heating.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">What is the Coriolis effect, and what causes it?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">The <strong>Coriolis effect</strong> is an apparent force that deflects moving objects (like air currents, ocean currents, and projectiles) from a straight path on a rotating body like Earth.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> It is caused by Earth's <strong>rotation</strong>. As Earth spins, points at the equator are moving faster than points closer to the poles. An object moving from the equator towards the pole carries its initial eastward velocity, causing it to appear to deflect eastward relative to the slower-moving ground beneath it. Conversely, an object moving from the pole towards the equator appears to deflect westward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direction of Deflection:</strong>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The <strong>jet stream</strong> is a narrow, fast-flowing, meandering air current found in the upper levels of the atmosphere (troposphere and lower stratosphere). They are typically thousands of kilometers long, a few hundred kilometers wide, and a few kilometers thick.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Jet streams are caused by the large temperature differences between air masses (e.g., cold polar air and warm tropical air) and the Coriolis effect. The greater the temperature difference, the stronger the pressure gradient, and thus the faster the wind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direction of Travel:</strong> Jet streams generally travel from <strong>west to east</strong> across Earth, following the global circulation patterns. There are typically two main jet streams in each hemisphere: the polar jet stream (stronger, closer to the poles) and the subtropical jet stream (weaker, closer to the equator).</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact on Air Travel:</strong>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li><strong>Eastbound flights:</strong> Aircraft flying eastward can utilize the tailwinds of the jet stream, significantly reducing flight time and fuel consumption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Westbound flights:</strong> Aircraft flying westward often try to avoid the jet stream's headwinds, which can increase flight time and fuel consumption. Pilots may choose to fly at lower altitudes or take different routes to minimize this effect.</li>

                    <li><strong>Leeward Side:</strong> On the leeward side (the side sheltered from the wind), the air is typically <strong>dry and warm</strong>. After releasing its moisture on the windward side, the now dry air descends the leeward side. As it descends, it compresses and warms, leading to clear skies and arid conditions.</li>

                    <li><strong>"Healthy" Glacier:</strong> A "healthy" glacier is one that is maintaining its size or growing, meaning its accumulation of snow and ice is greater than or equal to its ablation (melting and sublimation).</li>
                    <li><strong>Glaciers "in balance":</strong> A glacier is "in balance" when the rate of ice accumulation (from snowfall) in its upper reaches equals the rate of ice loss (from melting, sublimation, and calving) in its lower reaches. This means its mass balance is zero, and its size and position remain relatively stable over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Source of Ice:</strong> The source of ice in a glacier is <strong>accumulated snowfall</strong> that compacts and transforms into ice over time.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>How they move and flow:</strong> Glaciers move through two primary mechanisms:
                        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                            <li><strong>Internal Deformation (Creep):</strong> Under the immense pressure of its own weight, ice behaves as a plastic material and deforms internally. Ice crystals slide past each other, allowing the glacier to flow slowly downhill. This is more dominant in colder, polar glaciers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Basal Sliding:</strong> This occurs when the base of the glacier slides over the bedrock beneath it. This happens when meltwater accumulates at the bottom of the glacier, acting as a lubricant. This process is very important for faster-moving glaciers, especially temperate glaciers.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What happens at the bottom:</strong> At the bottom of a glacier, especially if it's temperate, <strong>meltwater</strong> can form due to pressure melting or geothermal heat. This meltwater reduces friction between the ice and the bedrock, allowing the glacier to slide more easily (basal sliding).</li>

                    <li><strong>Firn:</strong> <strong>Firn</strong> is partially compacted granular snow that is an intermediate stage between fresh snow and glacial ice. It has a density greater than fresh snow but less than glacial ice. It forms as snow crystals undergo compaction, melting, and refreezing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time to turn into glacial ice:</strong> The time it takes for snow to turn into glacial ice varies significantly depending on climate and snowfall rates. It can range from:

                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Crevasses</strong> are deep, vertical cracks or fissures that form in the brittle upper layer of a glacier. They form when the glacier flows over irregular terrain, changes in slope, or when different parts of the glacier move at different speeds, causing the ice to stretch or pull apart faster than it can deform plastically. The brittle ice fractures under the stress.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">How do glaciers recede? What is the process?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Glaciers <strong>recede</strong> (or retreat) when the rate of ice loss (ablation) exceeds the rate of ice accumulation. It's important to note that the glacier itself is still flowing forward, but its front (terminus) is melting back faster than the ice is advancing.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">The process involves:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Increased Melting:</strong> Higher temperatures lead to more surface melting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Sublimation:</strong> Ice turning directly into water vapor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Calving:</strong> For tidewater glaciers, warmer ocean waters can cause more rapid breaking off of icebergs at the terminus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Snowfall:</strong> Less snow accumulation means less new ice to replenish the glacier.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">When ablation outpaces accumulation, the glacier's mass balance becomes negative, and its terminus appears to move uphill or shrink.</p>

                            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> A stream that <strong>gains water from groundwater</strong> through its bed. The water table is higher than the stream bed, causing groundwater to flow into the stream.</li>
                            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Often maintains flow even during dry periods, as it is fed by groundwater.</li>

                            <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> A stream that <strong>loses water to the groundwater</strong> system through its bed. The water table is lower than the stream bed, causing stream water to seep down into the ground.</li>
                            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> May dry up during dry periods, as its water infiltrates the ground. Can contribute to aquifer recharge.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Spring:</strong> A <strong>spring</strong> is a natural outflow of groundwater from the Earth's surface where the water table intersects the land surface, or where groundwater emerges from a crack or fissure in the rock.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">How long is water in an aquifer (range of time)?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">The residence time of water in an aquifer can vary greatly, ranging from <strong>days to thousands of years</strong>, and in some very deep or confined aquifers, it can be <strong>millions of years</strong>. It depends on factors like the aquifer's permeability, size, depth, and the rate of recharge and discharge.</p>

                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li><strong>Lowering of the Water Table:</strong> The water table drops, requiring deeper wells and increasing pumping costs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Well Depletion:</strong> Existing wells may go dry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Land Subsidence:</strong> As water is removed from pore spaces, the overlying land can compact and sink, leading to irreversible ground-level lowering and damage to infrastructure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saltwater Intrusion:</strong> In coastal areas, over-pumping can draw saltwater from the ocean into freshwater aquifers, making the water unusable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced Streamflow/Springflow:</strong> Aquifers that feed streams and springs may no longer be able to sustain them, leading to reduced flow or drying up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increased Pumping Costs:</strong> Deeper pumping requires more energy and thus higher costs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Groundwater Contamination:</strong> Changes in flow patterns can draw contaminants into wells.</li>
