                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">Define the term/concept of environmental justice.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Environmental justice</strong> is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. It means that no group of people should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or policies.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Environmental issues frequently impact low-income and disadvantaged communities disproportionately due to a combination of historical factors, economic pressures, and systemic inequalities:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Human Health:</strong> These communities often live closer to polluting industries (e.g., factories, waste incinerators, chemical plants, highways), leading to higher exposure to air and water pollution. This can result in elevated rates of respiratory illnesses (asthma), cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and developmental problems, particularly in children. They may also have less access to quality healthcare to address these issues.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Access to Parks and Healthy Foods:</strong> Disadvantaged areas often lack sufficient green spaces, parks, and recreational areas, which are crucial for physical activity, mental well-being, and mitigating urban heat. They are also frequently "food deserts," meaning there is limited access to affordable, nutritious food options (fresh produce, whole grains) due to a scarcity of supermarkets, leading to reliance on convenience stores with processed, unhealthy foods.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Exposure to Harmful Pollutants:</strong> Beyond industrial pollution, these communities may face higher exposure to lead from old housing, contaminated soil, and hazardous waste sites. They might also live near agricultural areas impacted by pesticide drift or areas with poor waste management, further increasing their toxic burden. This disproportionate exposure is often linked to zoning laws, housing discrimination, and lack of political power to resist the siting of undesirable facilities.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>The parts of Phoenix that tended to be the hottest were the **densely built-up urban areas**, particularly those with a lot of **concrete, asphalt, and buildings**, and **less green space or tree cover**. These often corresponded to lower-income neighborhoods or industrial zones.</li>
                    <li>This is due to the **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect**. These materials (concrete, asphalt, dark roofs) absorb and retain significantly more solar radiation than natural landscapes. They then slowly release this heat throughout the day and night, keeping urban areas much warmer than surrounding rural areas or areas with more vegetation. Lack of shade from trees further exacerbates this.</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Cities can implement several strategies to decrease the amount of heat retained near the surface/ground (mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect):</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>**Increase Green Spaces and Tree Cover:** Planting more trees, creating parks, and incorporating green roofs provide shade and cool the air through evapotranspiration.</li>
                    <li>**Use Cool Pavements and Reflective Surfaces:** Utilizing lighter-colored materials for roads, sidewalks, and parking lots that reflect more sunlight rather than absorbing it.</li>
                    <li>**Install Cool Roofs:** Using reflective or "green" (vegetated) materials on building rooftops to reduce heat absorption.</li>
                    <li>**Promote Green Infrastructure:** Implementing permeable pavements, rain gardens, and bioswales that allow water to infiltrate and cool the surrounding environment.</li>
                    <li>**Strategic Urban Planning:** Designing city layouts that promote airflow, reduce building density in certain areas, and integrate natural cooling solutions.</li>
                    <li>**Efficient Building Design:** Encouraging buildings with better insulation, natural ventilation, and shading elements.</li>
                    <li>**Water Features:** Incorporating fountains, ponds, and other water bodies can have a localized cooling effect through evaporation.</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Air pressure **decreases** with increasing altitude (distance from Earth’s surface). This is because air pressure is caused by the weight of the column of air above a given point. As you go higher, there is less air above you, and therefore less weight pressing down, resulting in lower pressure. The air also becomes less dense at higher altitudes, meaning fewer air molecules are present.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">Explain how the composition of Earth’s atmosphere has changed over time, and why.</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">The composition of Earth’s atmosphere has changed dramatically over billions of years:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Early Atmosphere (Hadean Eon):</strong> Likely formed from volcanic outgassing, consisting primarily of water vapor, carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), nitrogen ($N_2$), and sulfur gases. Little to no free oxygen ($O_2$).</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Formation of Oceans & Carbon Sinks:</strong> As Earth cooled, water vapor condensed to form oceans. $CO_2$ dissolved into these oceans, forming carbonates and being locked away in rocks, significantly reducing atmospheric $CO_2$.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Rise of Photosynthesis (Proterozoic Eon - ~2.5 billion years ago):</strong> The emergence of photosynthetic organisms (like cyanobacteria) began to produce free oxygen ($O_2$) as a byproduct. This was a slow process, with much of the initial oxygen reacting with iron in the oceans.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>"Great Oxidation Event" (~2.4 billion years ago):</strong> Once iron sinks were saturated, oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere, leading to a dramatic increase in $O_2$ levels. This event was crucial for the evolution of aerobic life.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Evolution of Land Plants & Modern Atmosphere:</strong> Over geological time, the evolution of land plants further increased atmospheric $O_2$ and decreased $CO_2$. Volcanic activity continued to release gases, but biological processes became dominant in shaping the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Modern Composition:</strong> Today, the atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen ($N_2$), 21% oxygen ($O_2$), and trace amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">The primary drivers of these changes are **volcanic activity**, **the formation of oceans**, and most significantly, the **evolution and activity of life (especially photosynthesis and respiration)**, which fundamentally altered the balance of gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>

                    <li>**Nitrogen ($N_2$):** Approximately 78%. It is a relatively inert gas but is essential for life, primarily through the nitrogen cycle where it is "fixed" by bacteria into usable forms.</li>
                    <li>**Oxygen ($O_2$):** Approximately 21%. Crucial for respiration in most living organisms and for combustion.</li>
                    <li>**Argon (Ar):** Approximately 0.93%. An inert noble gas.</li>
                    <li>**Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):** Approximately 0.04% (and increasing). A vital greenhouse gas, essential for photosynthesis in plants.</li>
                    <li>**Water Vapor ($H_2O$):** Highly variable (0-4%). A powerful greenhouse gas, crucial for the water cycle and weather.</li>
                    <li>**Trace Gases:** Methane ($CH_4$), Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$), Ozone ($O_3$), etc., present in very small amounts but can have significant environmental impacts.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-2">What is the biosphere?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">The **biosphere** is the sum of all ecosystems on Earth. It is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Essentially, it is the zone of life on Earth, extending from the deepest parts of the oceans to the highest parts of the atmosphere where life exists.</p>

                            <li>**Oxygen Production:** Photosynthetic organisms (plants, algae, cyanobacteria) release vast amounts of oxygen ($O_2$) into the atmosphere, which was crucial in shaping Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere.</li>
                            <li>**Carbon Dioxide Regulation:** Photosynthesis removes $CO_2$ from the atmosphere, while respiration (by all living organisms) and decomposition release $CO_2$. This biological pump plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle and climate regulation.</li>
                            <li>**Other Gases:** Microorganisms produce gases like methane ($CH_4$) and nitrous oxide ($N_2O$), which are potent greenhouse gases.</li>
                            <li>**Dust/Aerosols:** Pollen, spores, and other biological particles can act as condensation nuclei, influencing cloud formation.</li>

                            <li>**Transpiration:** Plants release significant amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere through transpiration, contributing to atmospheric humidity and cloud formation. Forests, in particular, are major drivers of regional precipitation patterns.</li>
                            <li>**Infiltration and Runoff:** Vegetation cover influences how much precipitation infiltrates the soil versus running off the surface. Forests and grasslands typically promote infiltration, reducing surface runoff and erosion.</li>
                            <li>**Water Storage:** Plants and animals store water within their tissues.</li>
                            <li>**Cloud Formation:** Biological aerosols (e.g., from forests) can act as cloud condensation nuclei, influencing where and when clouds form.</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700">No, the amount of vegetation is **not the same** across Earth. It varies dramatically depending on climate, water availability, temperature, and soil conditions.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold mt-2">Where it is most concentrated and why:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
                    <li>**Most Concentrated:** Vegetation is most concentrated in **tropical rainforests** (near the equator) and other **humid, warm regions** with abundant rainfall and consistent temperatures. This includes regions like the Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, and parts of Southeast Asia.</li>
                    <li>**Why:** These areas provide the ideal conditions for plant growth:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>**High Solar Radiation:** Abundant sunlight for photosynthesis.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>**Least Concentrated:** Conversely, vegetation is sparse in deserts (lack of water), polar regions (extreme cold, limited liquid water), and very high mountain altitudes (cold, thin atmosphere, harsh conditions).</li>

                    <li>**Bioblitz:** A **Bioblitz** is an intense period of biological surveying in an attempt to record all the living species within a designated area. Typically, scientists, naturalists, and volunteers work together over a short period (e.g., 24 hours) to find and identify as many species as possible (plants, animals, fungi, microbes). It's a way to get a snapshot of biodiversity in a specific location and engage the public in citizen science.</li>
